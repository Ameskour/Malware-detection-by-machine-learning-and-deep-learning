# Project Title: Mastering Machine Learning for Penetration Testing

## Overview
This data science project focuses on building machine learning and deep learning models to detect malware by classifying executable files (exe, dll) as either legitimate or malicious. The project involves the implementation and comparison of three models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and a simple Neural Network. The dataset comprises 41,323 legitimate binaries and 96,724 malware files, featuring 56 metadata and characteristic-related features.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Removed unnecessary columns (filename, md5).
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

- **Model Building:**
  - Utilized three models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and a Neural Network.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Employed accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, etc., as evaluation metrics.

## File Structure
