# Malware Detection with Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Overview
This data science project focuses on detecting malware using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The project involves building three algorithms: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and a Neural Network (DL). The goal is to compare these models and select the best-performing one.

## Project Details

- **Models:**
  - Random Forest
  - Logistic Regression
  - Neural Network (DL)

## Dataset
- 41,323 legitimate binaries (exe, dll)
- 96,724 malware files

## Required Libraries
- Python 3
- Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, etc.
- For easy installation, run:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Project Steps
1. Importing necessary libraries and dataset.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing:
   - Handling variables like 'Name' and 'md5'.
   - Splitting the dataset into test and train sets.
4. Model Building:
   - Random Forest
   - Logistic Regression
   - Neural Network
5. Model Evaluation Metrics:
   - Accuracy
   - F1 Score
   - Confusion Matrix

## Results
- Random Forest Accuracy: ~98%
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~70%
- Neural Network Accuracy: ~96%

The neural network demonstrated the best performance on this dataset based on the accuracy metrics reported.

## Future Work
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for all models.
- Explore additional deep learning architectures.
- Investigate feature engineering and selection techniques.
- Experiment with ensemble methods for model combination.
